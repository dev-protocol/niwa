## <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

This Privacy Policy describes how we might use your information if you visit the Social Token Launcher website and engage with us in other related ways, including but not limited to any sales, marketing, or events.
In this Privacy Policy, if we refer to "Website" we are referring to any website of ours that references or links to this policy and "Services" to other related services, including but not limited to any sales, marketing, or events.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain to you in the most straightforward way possible what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have about it. If there are any terms in this Privacy Policy that you disagree with, please discontinue use of our Services immediately.

## <a name="collection">Collection</a>

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Website, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when you participate in activities on the Website (such as by posting messages in our online forums or entering competitions, contests) or otherwise when you contact us.

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Website, the choices you make, and the products and features you use.

The personal information we collect may include but is not limited to names, email addresses, job titles, usernames, contact preferences, contact or authentication data, digital wallet ID, and other similar information.

All personal information you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

## <a name="usage">Usage</a>

We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations.
We use the information we collect or receive:

- Request feedback. We may use your information to request feedback and contact you about your use of our Website.

- To enable user-to-user communications. We may use your information to help user-to-user communications with each user's consent.

- To manage user accounts. We may use your information to operate our account and keep it working order.

- To send administrative information to you. We may use your personal information to send you the product, service, new feature information, and/or information about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.

- To protect our Services. We may use your information as part of our efforts to keep our Website safe and secure (for example, for fraud monitoring and prevention).

- To enforce our terms, conditions, and policies for business purposes, comply with legal and regulatory requirements, or connect with our contract.

- To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. If we receive a subpoena or other lawful request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.

## <a name="sharing">Sharing</a>

We may process or share the data that we hold based on the following legal basis:
Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific permission to use your personal information for a particular purpose.

Legitimate Interests: We may process your data reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.

Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our agreement.

Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal processes, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).

Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

## <a name="storage">Storage</a>

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy unless a more extended retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this Privacy Policy will need us to keep your personal information for longer than the time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such data or, if this is not possible (for example, because your data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## <a name="safety">Safety</a>

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.

## <a name="rights">Rights</a>

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

## <a name="updates">Updates</a>

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date, and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
